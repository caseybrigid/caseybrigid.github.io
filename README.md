# Modeling Portfolio

My Modeling Portfolio @ [casey.github.io](https://casey.github.io)

## Adding/Replacing Images
1. Compress images for website before upload, this can be done using`compress.sh <infolder> <outfolder>`
2. Add new photos by placing them in src/public/<foldername>
3. re-compile and upload to github

## Todo
- [ ] Automate column/image placement in Portfolio
- [ ] Add photo credit overlay support
- [ ] Make easy update/reorder process for images (row major)

## Copying this site as a template?
If you'd like to use this site as a template, be sure to change the base address in the src/package.json build script, it makes this type of website (SPA's) work on github
